- parameter

- include
- @Parameters

Why we use this?
- When class/global variables carry the same name as local variables,
	to distinguish between global and local variables we use this in-front of global variables
	
POJO class
- Plain Old Java Object, POJO class is when a class do not have any dependency on any other class.

Priority attributes in @Test
- priority = O will always run first
- no priority define will run after priority = O
- if no priority has alphabetical order on top of priority = 0, then no priority will run first
- alphabetical order matters
- rest all priority will run after top two conditions

@groups in @Test attributes
- we can define more than one groups for a test
- to run we use <groups> inside <groups> we add <run>, inside <run> we can use <include> or <exclude> any groups

@retryAnalizer in @Test attributes with the class which has been implemented IRetryAnalyzer from TestNG
- to run the failed tests again
